# MM_Logo 

I used the programming language Java to fulfil the assignment.

Idea:
I noticed some dependencies between the '*' as well as between the '-'.
Because of the fact that the numeber of lines is always an even number, we can simply separate the logo 
into two halfs and print them separatly.
