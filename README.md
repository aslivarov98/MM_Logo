# MM_Logo 

I used the programming language Java to fulfil the assignment.

Idea:
I noticed some dependencies between the '*' as well as between the '-'.
Because of the fact that the number of lines needed to print the logo is always an even number, 
we can simply separate the logo into two halfs and print them separatly.
I created a class called MM_logo, which takes care of all the functionality that is necessery.
